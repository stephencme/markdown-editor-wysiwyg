## Tasks

- Improve table authoring UX with insert and edit controls
- Save inserted images to the workspace filesystem and write relative markdown image paths instead of `data:` URLs
- Support inserting images from remote URLs (preserve the remote link in markdown)
- Reduce extension-host CPU pressure in markdown sync path (`htmlToMarkdownSync` on `UPDATE`)
