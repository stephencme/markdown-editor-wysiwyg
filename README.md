## Usage

After installing the extension, your IDE will use it as the default editor for `.md` files. To use the built-in text editor instead, right-click a file and choose **Open with...** > **Text Editor (Built-In)**.

Note: your IDE may remember the last editor used for a specific file. If a Markdown file opens in the built-in editor, use **Open with...** > **Markdown Editor (WYSIWYG)** (or run **Open in Markdown Editor (WYSIWYG)**) to switch it back.

### View Source

The **"View Source"** button in the editor tab bar opens the raw Markdown in your IDE's built-in text editor. In Cursor 2.1+, editor action icons are [hidden by default](https://forum.cursor.com/t/editor-actions-icons-disappeared-in-2-1-0-version/143207). To show them, click on the three dots in the editor tab bar and select **Configure Icon Visibility**.

You can also run "View Source" from the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P).

### Open in Markdown Editor (WYSIWYG)

When a `markdown` file is open in the built-in text editor, the **"Open in Markdown Editor (WYSIWYG)"** button in the editor tab bar opens the rich text editor. The same icon visibility note above applies.

You can also run "Open in Markdown Editor (WYSIWYG)" from the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P).
